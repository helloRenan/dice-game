# 🎲 Dice Game

Welcome to the **Dice Game** repository! This project is a simple dice game built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The purpose of this project is to learn and practice JavaScript fundamentals, such as DOM manipulation, generating random numbers, and updating the UI dynamically.

---

## 📚 How the Game Works

1. **Page Refresh:** Every time the page is refreshed, two random numbers between 1 and 6 are generated (one for **Player 1** and one for **Player 2**).
2. **Dice Roll:** Based on the generated numbers, the images of dice corresponding to the rolled values are displayed for both players on the page.
3. **Winner:** The player with the higher roll wins the round. If both players roll the same number, it's a tie.

---

## 📌 Features

- **Random Dice Roll:** When you refresh the page, each player gets a random number from 1 to 6.
- **Dynamic UI Updates:** The dice images on the screen change according to the number generated for each player.
- **Responsive Layout:** The game is designed to look good on different screen sizes, making it accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.

## 💻 Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the game layout and content.
- **CSS**: For styling the game, including the dice images and overall design.
- **JavaScript**: For generating random numbers, handling logic, and updating the DOM with the dice images.

## 🎮 How to Play

1. Open the `index.html` file in a browser (or deploy the page online).
2. Every time you refresh the page, two dice are rolled—one for each player.
3. The dice images will update automatically, and the result will be displayed.
4. The player with the higher roll wins. If the dice values are the same, it's a tie.
